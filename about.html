            My name is Justin. I do computer science. I hope and intend
            to focus on software development. I graduated from Stuyvesant High
            School and attend Binghamton University, Watson School of
            Engineering.
            <br><br>
            I'm from Brooklyn, NY and I work as a Barista at Starbucks, located
            in the Macy's of Kings Plaza. I love it and it is the first of my
            jobs that I enjoy.
            <br><br>
            I'm good with Java, but I also have web dev experience. Technically
            a polyglot, as I speak English, Cantonese, and Spanish (I took AP
            Spanish) but don't test me on my Cantonese or Spanish. I enjoy
            music, mainly hip-hop and RnB I guess. I love <a>NAV</a>.
